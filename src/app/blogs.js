        content:`Hey there!

        I am writing this article for people who are interested in Machine Learning and are totally new to it.
        
        I am going to share with you some amazing resources that will take you from absolute beginner to intermediate level in Machine Learning.
        
        To learn you need resources it can be a book, a course, a YouTube video, or even an article.
        
        You will never know which resource will suit you and make you understand the concepts unless and until you go through a lot of them.
        
        For me personally, the free Machine Learning Courses by Kaggle.com really helped. 
        
        Even learn.microsoft.com has some amazing courses. Check out the Machine Learning Fundamental course by Microsoft. It‚Äôs really easy to read and understand, a must-read material for beginners.
        
        This is the courseüëâ Fundamentals Of Machine Learning by Microsoft
        
        Then to improve your knowledge further you need books.
        
        I never spent a penny on books but I have a lot of books.
        
        To get books, all I do is. Go to Google and search for the book I want in PDF format. Most of the time I will get it.
        
        For example, If I want the book, ‚ÄúHands-On Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow‚Äù I will just go to Google and type something like, ‚ÄúHands-On Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow PDF‚Äù
        
        
        Check the first link
        
        Got the book!
        Not only this book. You can get any books you want if you search for it.
        
        I have got plenty of books through this method.
        
        
        There is more.
        Another method I use is a secret, but I am gonna reveal it to you.
        
        There is also a website called libgen.is.
        
        You can get almost any book you want from it.
        
        Let me show you a live example, let say I want the book, ‚ÄúMachine Learning Yearning‚Äù by Andrew Ng.
        
        
        This is libgen.is
        
        Got the book!
        This is the process.
        
        In case you are not able to get it from Google search you can try this approach.
        
        It doesn‚Äôt stop here, you can find plenty of free courses online.
        
        YouTube is a great place to learn from video content. Coursera has plenty of Free courses as well.
        
        To be honest, all you need to do is search if you really search for what you want online 99% of the time you will get it (for free).
        
        But I highly recommend you to first go through the reading before moving on to video content.
        
        When you are not able to understand a concept even after reading so many time, you can go for video content.
        
        ‚ÄúReading is faster than listening‚Äù.
        
        Learning from reading is the best and fastest way to learn things quickly. Video content may be good when it comes to project building.
        
        But when you are just starting out read as much as possible.
        
        So, here is a summary. First, get your fundamentals strong.
        
        Then get books using the methods I shared with you and start learning more deeply.
        
        I will also share some Machine Learning Projects that you can try to improve your knowledge further.
        
        One thing I realized is this, even if you are just learning for 30 minutes every day just do it consistently. Consistency really helps. Never miss a day.
        
        That‚Äôs it.`

    content:`I vividly recall a particular interview question: ‚ÄòWhy is it crucial to package a model into a container instead of just reloading the serialized model file in the existing deployment?‚Äô The answer to this question mirrors the essence of why automated pipelines play a pivotal role in the construction and deployment of machine learning models. The key lies in pursuing an ‚Äòimmutable‚Äô process ‚Äî one that seamlessly runs through the same steps from start to finish, devoid of any ‚Äòside effects‚Äô that could complicate the troubleshooting of model behavior changes, such as disparities in Python package versions between data scientists‚Äô laptops.

    Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), originating from and gaining prominence in Software Development, is centered around the idea of regularly delivering incremental changes to a live application via an automated process of rebuilding, retesting, and redeploying.
    
    Can this approach benefit Machine Learning models? Absolutely. Yet, the primary reason for automating these processes is the inherent susceptibility of Machine Learning models to degradation, necessitating regular (or at least occasional) retraining with new data and subsequent redeployment.
    
    In contrast to traditional CI/CD pipelines for standard software applications, Machine Learning introduces two additional dimensions: Model and Data. While conventional software engineering practices revolve around code, ML involves extensive codebases alongside the management of substantial datasets and models to extract actionable insights.
    
    Designing an ML system involves grappling with challenges like:
    
    Storing model artifacts and enabling teams to track experiments with their metadata for result comparability and reproducibility.
    Handling often large and rapidly changing datasets. In addition to monitoring model performance from an application standpoint, ML demands vigilance in tracking data changes and adjusting models accordingly.
    ML systems demand consistent monitoring for performance and data drift. When model accuracy dips below a set baseline or data experiences concept drift, the entire system must undergo another cycle. This means replicating all steps, from data validation to model training and evaluation, testing, and deployment. This underscores why ML systems stand to gain significantly from automated pipelines, especially in the context of CI/CD.
    
    In the upcoming sections, we‚Äôll delve into how CI/CD pipelines for Machine Learning deviate from traditional integration and delivery in software development.
    
    Exploring The Machine Learning Lifecycle
    The Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle is a structured sequence of stages, critical for developing, deploying, and continuously improving ML models. This lifecycle is central to ensuring models remain effective and relevant in dynamic production environments.
    
    Model Development (Experimentation Phase)
    Machine learning is fundamentally an exploratory field, diverging from traditional software development‚Äôs linear paths. In this experimentation phase, data scientists and ML engineers engage in a creative process, prototyping and iterating over various models. They apply diverse techniques to explore data and algorithms, aiming to uncover the most effective solutions. While automation might not be central to this stage, the goal is clear: to identify and refine promising models for deployment, thereby enhancing the value delivered to end-users. This phase culminates with the selection of models ready to enter the ML CI/CD pipeline for further development and deployment.
    
    2. Model Integration and Training (Build Phase)
    
    Once a model is conceptualized, it enters the build phase. Here, new or updated code is tested and constructed into container images, which are then used for both training the model and serving predictions. The result is a trained model, stored in a Model Registry, and its associated container images housed in a container registry. This phase ensures that the model is not only trained with the latest data but is also packaged for efficient deployment and testing, marking a critical integration point in the lifecycle.
    
    3. Model Deployment
    
    The deployment phase sees the new model deployed in a production environment, serving either all traffic or a portion, contingent on the chosen release strategy. Best practices recommend employing separate environments like staging and production or implementing shadow (canary) deployments to receive duplicated live traffic without impacting users. The outcome is a production service for the model.
    
    4. Monitoring and Retraining (Maintenance)
    
    The final phase in the lifecycle is where the deployed model is closely monitored to assess its performance against predefined metrics and baselines. Monitoring helps identify when a model begins to drift or underperform due to changing data patterns or other factors. This phase is not the end but a trigger for a new cycle of improvement ‚Äî initiating retraining, adjustments, or complete redevelopment as needed. It‚Äôs here that the lifecycle truly embodies a continuous loop, with insights from monitoring feeding directly back into development and training, ensuring that models evolve and improve perpetually.
    
    
    Continuous Integration (CI) in Machine Learning
    In traditional software development, the activation of a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is an essential process triggered by the introduction of new code into a source control platform. This pipeline evaluates the code through various processes such as unit testing, linting, security vulnerability checks, and the assembly of a container image. Following this construction phase, the pipeline may proceed to local code execution or move towards deployment in a staging environment for comprehensive end-to-end testing. The culmination of this process is the publishing of the containerized code to a container registry.
    
    In Machine Learning (ML) applications, while the CI process integrates many principles of traditional software CI, it also exhibits a distinct focus and scope. The primary goal in ML CI revolves around ensuring code quality and functionality, preparing the codebase for subsequent phases of the ML lifecycle.
    
    The separation of model training and evaluation from the CI pipeline in ML is driven by several key reasons:
    
    Complexity and Resource Requirements: Model training often demands significant computational resources, including specialized hardware like GPUs. Integrating such resource-intensive tasks into the CI phase is impractical and could impede the efficiency of the code integration process.
    Separation of Concerns: By decoupling the model training phase from the integration process, there is greater flexibility in the development workflow. Training can be conducted independently with various parameters and evaluation methods. Simultaneously, CI can proceed unencumbered, enabling direct deployment of the model using pre-existing trained models without necessitating retraining during each integration cycle.
    Iterative Nature of ML Development: Model training in ML is inherently iterative, often involving experimentation with different parameters and methods. Including this iterative training within the CI workflow would significantly slow down the process, hindering the rapid iteration and integration that CI aims to achieve.
    As a result of these considerations, the outcome of the CI phase in ML is a packaged model code, prepared and ready for deployment in either a prediction serving or a training environment. This separation ensures that the model is primed for training, evaluation, and eventual deployment, adhering to the unique requirements and workflows inherent in ML development.
    
    Tools for Continuous Integration
    For the purposes of this article, we‚Äôve chosen to demonstrate the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions. This choice is informed by the platform‚Äôs widespread adoption and its rich library of community-curated ‚ÄòActions‚Äô, which greatly simplify the creation of CI workflows.
    
    Why GitHub Actions?
    
    Integration with GitHub: As a GitHub-native solution, GitHub Actions offers the advantage of residing in the same ecosystem as your code. This integration eliminates the need for navigating between different platforms, streamlining the development process.
    Workflow Automation: GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating build, test, and deployment processes. It allows for the creation of workflows that automatically build and test each pull request, ensuring that changes are ready for deployment.
    Alternatives: CircleCI and Jenkins
    
    While GitHub Actions serves as our primary example, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge alternatives like CircleCI and Jenkins. Both are capable of achieving similar outcomes:
    
    CircleCI: Known for its ease of use and quick setup, CircleCI is a strong contender, especially for teams looking for a straightforward, cloud-based CI solution.
    Jenkins: As an open-source platform, Jenkins offers a high degree of customization and control, making it a preferred choice for teams with complex, bespoke CI requirements.`}

    content:`I left Amazon to pursue other opportunities to fuel my career growth. When I joined Amazon Vancouver, the office was small with less than 200 employees. At the time I decided to leave, Amazon Vancouver had offices in multiple buildings incorporating thousands of employees. On my last day with the company, more than 97% overall of Amazon employees were hired after me. Both Amazon and myself experienced growth simultaneously.

    TL;DR
    I joined during one of the darkest times at Amazon. Thanks to the New York Times controversial article in 2015 (one year after I joined), Amazon started some internal changes to improve the work environment. I came on board as a junior engineer and left as a senior. Looking back on my time as an Amazon employee, I do realize that I had made a lot of mistakes on the job. However, I‚Äôm happy that at least I can now recognize what I did wrong and avoid making the same mistakes again over time. To cut the story short, it‚Äôs hard for me to think of specific times where I felt indifferent regarding Amazon. My emotion toward the company was basically either love or hate. Based on my personal experience, I would like to share some of the things that I liked the most about Amazon and what I think could be improved or changed altogether.
    
    What I liked a lot about Amazon
    These are some of the reasons I enjoyed while working at Amazon. The company possesses many positive traits that can be beneficial to the growth and development of your career and expertise.
    
    The ultimate ownership
    One thing I really loved about working at Amazon is that you are not simply assigned a task to follow blindly. Instead, you are responsible for owning a project from start to finish. In some instances, you are only given a vague description of what needs to be done. Therefore, you have to communicate with many people to clarify the problem. Then, you follow suit by preparing a design, talk to more people, and revise the plan till you reach the final consensus. Afterwards, you can continue with implementation, testing, and a launch plan. Even after the completion, you continue watching the project to make sure it has been a successful feature.
    
    Even as an engineer, you are expected to evaluate if a project really makes sense and make the necessary adjustments to create a path for successful implementation.
    
    Engineering Excellence
    Many services at AWS (Amazon Web Services) are pay-as-you-go. This means that the customers are only charged whenever their services are running reliably. Consequently, AWS receives nothing if the services are not running as expected. A similar situation exists for the retail website as customers cannot purchase efficiently if any of the dependent services are not working properly. So, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine that engineering excellence should be a key factor in any feature launches at Amazon.
    
    That‚Äôs why as an engineer, you should always prioritize keeping engineering excellence in mind. For every feature launch, you need to have enough code coverage, reliable tests, proper metrics and alarms, an effective dashboard, and last but not least a detailed runbook to reduce the possibility and effects of potential issues.
    
    A lot of learning resources
    A wide range of learning materials are available internally at Amazon to help you ramp up quickly and resolve almost every possible issue in a short space of time. There is a Youtube-like channel for internally sourced and created educational videos, a stack-overflow type website in which engineers can seek help from their peers, and an efficient searching system that looks for anything inside wikis, emails, or codes to name a few.
    
    Your [technical] voice is heard regardless of your seniority
    In engineering discussions, what you say matters more than your level. In my ‚Äúcustomer obsession‚Äù training class for the new hires, I was always encouraging them to challenge others‚Äô decisions, especially if there was no clear rational reason behind them. I have been also advising them to not accept things just because they were expected to. In many meetings such as special design review sessions, I‚Äôve seen many occurrences in which a junior asks challenging questions from a senior and the senior had to present a meaningful answer. No engineer should respond in a way that gives the impression that they are always right because they have seniority. They should be open to discussion, no matter their level.`

        content:`Hello, and welcome!

        My name is Benoit. I have been a software engineer for the past eight and a half years. I stayed at my previous (and first) company for seven and a half years, then I joined a new one in early 2022.
        
        This article comes from a recent self-reflection on the things I wish I had started doing earlier in my career and the things I wish I had done differently.
        
        What I am sharing here may be useful to any junior to mid-level developer who wishes to improve and progress toward the title of senior and beyond.

        My Career Evolution
        Before diving into the main subject, here is my career evolution:
        
        I interned for three months at a startup (which quickly became a scale-up) company.
        After that, I did a full year of work-study, spending three months at school and nine months at work.
        Then, I got hired as a full-time software engineer and kept this title for three and a half years.
        Quickly after the introduction of the tech career ladder, I got promoted to senior software engineer. I kept this title for three years until I left the company, at which point the tech teams accounted for approximately 200 people.
        I joined as a software engineer 2 at a company with thousands of tech employees. Despite the title downgrade at the second company (see Big Tech Hiring is Conservative ‚Äî But Why?), I have been trying to keep the same responsibilities (and more) as before.
        
        Illustration of my career evolution over the past 8.5 years.
        In the beginning, I was part of the frontend team. The tech organisation was split between backend and frontend developers. At that time, we were no more than 30 engineers. When our new CTO arrived a year later, he introduced an organisation based on feature teams: the Spotify Model. Although there was some friction at the start (people don‚Äôt like change), this reorganisation definitely turned out to be for the better.
        
        I stayed for more than five years in the same feature team. I was there at its inception, so throughout the years, I became the tech referent of the project. Eventually, I joined another team, where I worked until I left for a whole new adventure a year later.
        
        All right, enough with the context. I hope you‚Äôll enjoy reading the rest, and that the following advice will be actionable for your career progression!
        
        Things I Wish I Had Started Doing Earlier
        Write a work log
        A work log is a document that contains the list of tasks you accomplished. The granularity and the type of tasks don‚Äôt matter, as long as you keep track of what you did.
        
        You can fill in this document at the frequency you want. I would advise doing that on a weekly basis. Tasks done during the week are still fresh on Friday, so you won‚Äôt struggle writing them down.
        
        Why is this work log important? For the following two reasons:
        
        To remind yourself of all the things you have done over the past 6 to 12 months. This is very valuable during performance reviews, so you can show your manager what you have accomplished and why you deserve that raise or promotion.
        To keep track of projects, notable responsibilities, and critical numbers (e.g., decreased latency by X% for a critical service) that you had over your career. This is great for completing your resume, whenever you want to venture into the waters of the hiring market.
        I started writing a work log roughly two years before leaving my first company. So, over the past eight and a half years, my work log contains only three years of data (with some gaps here and there). When I had to write my resume in late 2021, I had to rely on my memory to remember what I did during the first five years of my career. To say the least, it took me some time to remember everything valuable, and I‚Äôm sure I forgot some of them.
        
        You can use a work log template if you want to (here is an example). Personally, I have been using Microsoft Notes for the first two years, then I switched to a Google Doc with bullet points (one list for each month of the year).
        
        Leave the comfort zone
        This is the best way to learn and become a better developer. The comfort zone is the scope, environment in which you feel comfortable doing your job. It is the teammates you already know and work with daily, the projects you have been working on for years, the responsibilities you have been carrying, and so on.
        
        But why would someone advise you to leave this wonderful situation? Because this environment is not suitable for evolution.
        
        Sure, if you stay in this bubble, you are an efficient person. You already know who to talk to about a specific subject, and what file in the codebase has to be changed. But what is better than one efficient person? Several efficient people!
        
        Once you have reached the comfort zone on a particular topic, you should look for:
        
        Mentoring people, so they become comfortable with this topic.
        Look for something new to do outside of your comfort zone.
        Mentoring is one of the responsibilities that is expected from a senior position. It is a great way of helping our coworkers to be more efficient quickly. You become a force multiplier.
        
        As for the new things to do, it could be anything. Here is a non-exhaustive list for inspiration:
        
        Contribute to a team/organisation project you never had the chance to touch before, e.g., because it was always assigned to the same person (who was in their comfort zone).
        Write documentation about a topic you are comfortable with. The objective is to share your knowledge and indirectly mentor people so they can get this knowledge faster than you did. Also, writing is a great skill to learn and improve, be it for documentation, emails, instant messages, RFCs (Requests For Comments), blog posts, etc.
        Volunteer to participate in cross-team projects. You can even take a leadership position during these projects to feed two birds with one hand.
        Take care of improving tooling, monitoring, or team/organisation processes.
        Participate in meetups organised by the company.
        Join a community/guild at the company to work on org-level, cross-teams projects.
        Help the hiring team by conducting technical interviews, and/or checking take-home exercises from candidates.
        The goal is to learn something new. Performance reviews can help you define what to do, and how to do it when stepping outside your comfort zone. But you don‚Äôt have to wait for this moment to make the move. You can do that at any time, as long as your manager is aware of it. For instance, you can talk about it during a 1‚Äì1 meeting. One of the core objectives of your manager is to help you progress in your career, so I highly recommend talking with them before leaving your comfort zone.
        
        There may be some subjects you don‚Äôt really care about. In my case, for a long time, I didn‚Äôt want to learn anything related to machine learning and data analytics. But, my curiosity and thirst for knowledge eventually led me on the path of these topics. Even though I didn‚Äôt get the chance to work on company projects based on these fields, I am glad I learned about them. It is great to have meaningful conversations with my peers, and it can even help me find ideas I couldn‚Äôt get without this knowledge.
        
        If you want to progress in your career, I strongly encourage you to leave your comfort zone and learn new things every time you get the chance. And I‚Äôm pretty sure this advice also applies to one‚Äôs personal life too!`}

        content:`It is 2:19 am and you just checked the time.

        ‚ÄúDammit, not again‚Äù you whisper
        
        You ate your dinner on time and read 10 pages with eyes full of drowsiness just to tick off things from your daily to-do list. You pick up your phone to scroll a little bit because you think you‚Äôve earned the leisure by working for 30 min straight. You look at the time and it‚Äôs already past 2 am. You‚Äôve repeated the circle yet again.
        
        Now this is not to tell you that to-do lists are a waste of time and you shouldn‚Äôt create patterns. This is just a wake-up call for you ‚Äî to let you know that these methods, tactics and ‚Äú5 ways to be more productive‚Äù articles won‚Äôt help you unless you‚Äôre serious.
        
        The pattern of growing up
        Everyone wants to be better but only some have the heart to follow that path. People like routine but they love comfort even more. If you‚Äôre a student, you would like to get good grades but also maintain a social life. You will want to go out, have coffee with your friends, go to concerts and make the best of your teens. If you‚Äôre a working professional, the set paychecks make you lazy. You wake up, go to work, start with the tasks and by the end of the day you don‚Äôt have any more energy to pick up your laptop for doing anything else. Hobbies like writing, gaming, and crafting are all somewhere in the attic in a box.
        
        You see- here is a pattern. You find comfort in the life you build. Now why would you want to break it and make your life miserable? Why eat healthier, why go to the gym, why start a blog, why establish your long-wanted business?
        
        Where there is comfort, there is no room for improvement.
        
        The fallacy of advice
        Now some people would rather live a life of comfort but then there are people like you- who want change. You want a better health and a better income. You are different because you‚Äôd rather give up comfort today to live a better life 5 years from now.
        
        But where does your sadness emerge from? Let‚Äôs break it down.
        
        You look up online and find the best self-improvement articles.
        
        10 ways to be better than other people?
        Live a stoic life and you‚Äôll rediscover yourself.
        5 ways to be more productive and get things done
        Even I write such articles and most of the time, these things work for me. But, what works for them shouldn‚Äôt necessarily work for you.
        
        You wouldn't teach a monkey how to fly or a bird how to bark. Most of the time this advice is a path for you to discover what works best for you. Instead of finding a way of your own, you follow the rules set by other people and when the results don‚Äôt come you‚Äôre feeling down.
        
        For example ‚Äî the Pomodoro technique works for me, but not in the way people tell. Usually ‚Äî you work for 30 min and take a rest for the next 5. I hated this work. As soon as I would get in the flow my times would buzz and it was telling me to take a break.
        
        Until I realised that Pomodorro should not be taken at face value. It‚Äôs not a 30 min ‚Äî 5 min rule. The rule is to take a break every time you feel blocked. So instead of setting a timer ‚Äî I let myself get in the work mode. I stayed there for 1‚Äì2 hours until I felt like taking a break. This is what worked for me.
        
        Stop doing what they tell you to do
        We‚Äôre inundated with tips and tricks on how to live our best lives. And yet, despite your best efforts to follow their sage advice, you often find yourself falling short. Why? Because we‚Äôre not putting in the real work.
        
        Ask yourself, as you reading that book because you like it or because your list says so? Are you working because you like it or just because your list says so? Are you not meeting your friends because you don‚Äôt want to or because your list says to stay stoic?
        
        To better yourself does not mean to change everything that makes you-you!
        
        It‚Äôs like trying to learn French by binge-watching Netflix instead of speaking the language.
        
        As the Stoic philosopher Epictetus reminds us, ‚ÄúFirst say to yourself what you would be, and then do what you have to do.‚Äù Instead of fixating on endless to-do lists, focus on the essence of what you want to achieve. What kind of person do you want to become? What values do you want to embody? By aligning your actions with your core values and priorities, you can cultivate a sense of purpose and fulfilment that transcends the superficiality of mere tasks.
        
        The Myth of ‚ÄúGetting Better‚Äù
        ‚ÄúGet better,‚Äù they say. But what does that even mean? And who gets to define what ‚Äúbetter‚Äù looks like anyway? Is it working more? Is it eating healthier? Is it working like a robot with a schedule to even breathe?
        
        The truth is, that the pursuit of improvement is most fulfilling when it‚Äôs driven by internal motivation, not external expectations. It‚Äôs about following your own North Star, whether that leads you down the path of a nomad, a stoic, or a hybrid of both. The definition of better varies from person to person. Then don‚Äôt apply those strategies to your life ‚Äî if the goals don‚Äôt align.
        
        ‚ÄúThe obstacle is the path.‚Äù Embrace the challenges, setbacks, and detours on your journey of self-improvement. Each obstacle is an opportunity for growth, a chance to learn, adapt, and evolve. By embracing the messy, unpredictable nature of life, you can cultivate resilience, strength, and wisdom that far surpasses any superficial notion of ‚Äúgetting better.‚Äù
        
        Finding Balance
        In the journey to better yourself, don‚Äôt forget to accept yourself. Most people fall behind this trap and set unrealistic expectations for themselves ‚Äî when those are not met, they punish themselves.
        
        Even scientifically ‚Äî it takes the mind at least 18 days to create a habit and fit into a new routine. How can you expect your body to do that in 2 days?
        
        Becoming a better version of yourself is less about the tactics you follow and more about the mindset you have.
        
        If you achieve something today ‚Äî great. Pat yourself on the back.
        If the best thing you did was to get out of bed and do minimal work ‚Äî great. Pat yourself on the back.
        Don‚Äôt treat yourself like an algorithm that needs to ‚Äòearn‚Äô appreciation.
        
        It‚Äôs all about balance. Yes, strive to be better, but also learn to accept yourself exactly as you are in this moment. Embrace your quirks, your imperfections, and your beautifully messy humanity.
        
        It‚Äôs okay to have days when you feel like a productivity powerhouse and days when you just want to binge-watch in your pyjamas. Life is a delicate dance between growth and acceptance, and finding that balance is the key to true fulfilment.
        
        Here‚Äôs some advice that helped me in my journey:
        
        Set Intentions, Not Goals: Instead of fixating on specific outcomes, focus on setting intentions for how you want to show up in the world. Intentions are flexible, adaptable, and rooted in your values, making them far more sustainable than rigid goals.
        No, setting intentions does not mean you‚Äôre weak-minded. It means that you‚Äôre ready to give yourself the time to create new, longterm habits instead of rushing your body through a harsh cycle.
        
        2. Practice Self-Compassion, not self-forgiveness: Be kind to yourself, especially when you fall short of your expectations.
        
        This is tricky because if not done right, people mistake it for cheat days. Compassion does not mean you‚Äôll forgive yourself each time. If someone treats you badly and says sorry each time ‚Äî you‚Äôll get tired of the repeated cycle. Don‚Äôt be that toxic person.
        
        Being compassionate should not be co-related to being forgiving. Improvement requires a strong mentality so you cannot keep skipping important tasks and treating them as ‚Äòjust-another-day‚Äô
        
        3. Cultivate Curiosity: Approach life with a sense of curiosity and wonder, embracing the unknown and exploring new possibilities. Keep asking questions, seeking knowledge, and staying open to growth. The smartest people I‚Äôve met have never known they were the smartest in the room.
        
        One should always reach for more knowledge. The day you think you know everything about that topic is the day you‚Äôve lost. Create a habit of reading, listening to podcasts or watching informational videos. You never know when you learn something life-changing.
        
        4. Celebrate Your Quirks: Your quirks are what make you uniquely you, so celebrate them unabashedly. Embrace your weirdness, your eccentricities, and your idiosyncrasies ‚Äî it‚Äôs what sets you apart from the crowd. Give yourself appreciation and record the things you‚Äôre proud of.
        
        The days when you don‚Äôt feel your best, go back to this record. It‚Äôll help you look back and appreciate how far in the journey you‚Äôve come.
        
        5. Connect with Your Why: When embarking on the journey of self-improvement, always connect with your why. What is driving you to grow and evolve? Keep that why front and centre as your guiding star.
        
        This is the most important for me. I‚Äôve written my ‚Äòwhy‚Äô on a post-it note and stuck it to my work desk. Whenever I sit there, that ‚Äòwhy‚Äô is the first thing I read and it fires me up. Never forget why you started and keep pushing for that goal.`

        content:`ur family called her Oma.

        Oma passed away in late January, at the age of 88.
        
        A few months after the cremation, our family cleaned up her house and organized her belongings, including her cabinets ‚Äî where we found the book. A small-sized scrapbook with a pink fabric cover and tied by a small rope. It caught my attention immediately, as I had always loved the idea of scrapbooks. Flipping pages through pages of glued photos, butterfly stickers, and the captions underneath, I was in awe. She decorated some of the pages like she was a Pinterest user. No wonder, she had always been the painter of the family.
        
        Looking at all the candid smiles captured in black and white, every page felt so sincere and genuine. There was a photo of her and her friends standing beside a waterfall and a river. I felt like she took me back to the 50s‚Ä¶ felt the wind blowing on my hair, the water coming up on my feet, and the sun kissing my face. I could see her running around, laughing with her friends, taking photos of each other. And I could feel the joy. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù she wrote underneath a photo of the waterfall. I guess my grandma was always a curious cat, just like her grandchildren.
        
        On another bundle of scrapbooks, she kept all of her family photos ‚Äî including photos of grandpa when he was a young man. This scrapbook took me on a journey of their marriage, and their small family, until the last page that was filled with photos of grandpa and their young children‚Äìwhich were my mom, uncles, and aunt. Honestly, it reminded me of the Adventure Book from the movie ‚ÄúUp‚Äù. How sweet of her to keep all the memories alive in a book. She was no longer here, but she passed down the memories to me and my siblings as we found her old scrapbook. I never thought about how my grandma had a whole life before she was as old as I had always known her to be. In these scrapbooks, she was even younger than I am now. She looked so pretty, her hair was wavy and beautiful, she was fashionable, and she looked so‚Ä¶ healthy.
        
        In the past few months, I saw the drastic decline of her health condition and it was really devastating for our family. I learned how to play chess, as it was her favorite game. We wanted to stimulate her brain and uplift her spirit because she was extremely good at chess! Due to her unbeatable track record, I liked to call her the grand master of chess. When I played chess with my uncle, I spent an extremely long time thinking about my next move simply because I was the worst. My brain just couldn‚Äôt keep up whatsoever, so I asked for her help. At first, she refused to join and she wanted to lay on the couch, just watching us play. But after minutes of waiting for me to make a move, she probably couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore and decided to help. From then on, she played chess with my uncle pretty often. I was still excluded, as I was still the worst at playing chess.
        
        But this time, surprisingly, she was lost to my uncle.
        
        Grandma knew that her body was deteriorating. Ever since she fell on her elbow, everything took a turn for the worse in such a short period of time. She had a hard time walking on her own. She began to forget places, her friends, her family, including me. There was a time when I came to her house as she was sunbathing outside in her wheelchair. ‚ÄúHi, Oma!‚Äù I greeted her excitedly. She looked at me but she didn‚Äôt reply. I could tell that she was confused.
        
        My grandma could not recognize me.
        
        ‚ÄúHi, Oma. This is Cherie, your grandchild,‚Äù I smiled and waved. She just smiled and nodded, which broke me even more. It was really hard because we were still joking around just a few weeks ago. There were photos of her smiling, posing with a cast on her elbow and I still remember how she complained about the photos because her hair looked messy. She laughed at her own hair and told me to delete the photo, which I refused. It was the last photo we had of grandma before her health began to deteriorate. Her memory began to crumble even more and she had a hard time to even speak. We were always by her side until she was bedridden in the hospital and passed away a few weeks later.`

        content:`In a world that‚Äôs full of words, I sometimes sat quietly in the hum around me with thoughts of my own about the existence of the words itself

        About why they‚Äôre here and how they can magically lighten up our eyes
        
        About all the 26 letters, along with their curves and lines, and the unique characteristics they bring to us, as well as how we can carry them
        
        All in all, so that we can have a beautiful conversation with our surroundings
        
        In a world that‚Äôs full of words, I find it odd sometimes that we, myself included, like to keep things silent, or, more specifically, delimit our words and then hope to be understood by others
        
        After all, aren‚Äôt they created so we can listen and see their beauty?
        
        These thoughts visits me often, crossing in the back of my head as I was seeing people walk right in front of my eyes. Silently, I wonder if they also think the same thing as I did
        
        Maybe if I came up to them and asked, they‚Äôd give me the answer
        
        So, this is me questioning
        
        why are we afraid of asking?
        
        why are we afraid to tell other people what we want?
        
        to ask for help
        
        to coming upfront
        
        to ask for a favor
        
        to communicate the truth
        
        to tell what we need
        
        was it because of the reaction?
        
        the unknown of what lay ahead within their answer
        
        or is it the rejection that can be hurt to hear?
        
        quite frankly I‚Äôm tired of preserving my words
        
        of leaving the canvas blank
        
        of leaving the paper untouched
        
        of leaving the room empty
        
        soundless and soulless
        
        for I wish to speak the way my mind talks
        
        fearlessly and incessantly
        
        because I think that it is never a bad thing to do so
        
        It is never wrong to ask
        
        It is never wrong to tell
        
        It is never wrong to want to be understood
        
        to simplify life by expressing
        
        by talking, by asking
        
        and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs shame in all of that
        
        Maybe keeping words has been an easier choice given the fact that we all have our own fears. The fear of asking because it might turn into annoyance, the fear of telling because it might not sound genuine, the fear of rejection, and the list goes on.
        
        It‚Äôs unrealistic yet irresistibly real. Looking back, there were a lot of moments and things that I got simply because of asking, telling, and communicating. And as soon as I realize that I can‚Äôt always have what I‚Äôm not willing to ask for, life becomes easier.
        
        As far as I go through this life, I learned that we‚Äôre not going to lose anything by asking
        
        because when we ask, we‚Äôre not just explaining, but we‚Äôre giving options. Either they‚Äôre going to agree, or disagree. Either the answer is going to be yes, or they‚Äôre going to be no. And although it can be hard to hear those disagreements and nos, at least we tried. And in the end, all that matters is what we can have control of. So might as well just focus on that

        content:`How comforting it is, to know that the dreams you never once got in this universe are fulfilled by a different version of you in another. Instead of regretting what could‚Äôve been, imagine the possibilities that life has to offer each day. How many versions of you are living a similar but also different lives within the multiverse? Ten maybe? Or just five?

        The limited-edition Bratz doll you missed out on when you were seven is owned by another version of you somewhere else. The high school sweetheart who broke your heart might be married to you in another reality, happily raising two children in a beautiful home. In a different universe, the mom who was absent in your life is finally there, attending every event and creating memories with you as she should.
        
        Somewhere in these galaxies, all the fiasco you went under are non-existent. All the chances you missed out on are achieved ‚Ä¶ cherished.
        
        These versions of us are destined to be somewhere, may it be good or bad. These versions of us are beautifully crafted to experience a life like no other.
        
        Your struggles now may be the joys another version of you is celebrating and the joys you have now are the ones they long for too.
        
        When things don‚Äôt work out, let them go. Trust the universe to take them where they‚Äôre needed. If plans change, accept it, and if things go as planned, great! Give yourself credit and hope that another version of you in the multiverse is managing well despite the challenges.
        
        Believing in something greater, no matter how strange it seems, gives us space to breathe. It helps us learn to accept and understand what we can and cannot control. Finding comfort in child-like beliefs is also a form of maturity, allowing us the freedom to pursue the greatness meant for us.
        
        It‚Äôs all in the multiverse now
        
        One way or another, the things you have lost may find its way back to you. But for now, breathe here, live here. This is where and who you are meant to be. You may not like what you see now, but that doesn‚Äôt hinder you from seeing greater things in the future. You have so much time, it is always on your side. Do not worry, you are capable of this life, you are destined for greatness. The universe has its wonders, and so do you.
        
        Control only what you can, then let the multiverse take over.`

        content:` was reading our old messages when I came across the question. I remembered it was almost 3 am. I was lying on my bed, lights out, with my phone screen lighting up my face. Well, obviously a weird topic had to come up in those hours. If it wasn‚Äôt from him, then without any doubt it would come from me.

        ‚ÄúThe loneliest object??‚Äù I scoffed at how absurd he could be sometimes.
        
        ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go first. The loneliest object in the world is a thrown-away plastic bottle. Always got thrown away after being used. We know it is not gonna be one with the soil, not anytime soon‚Ä¶ so it just has to be there existing, waiting for its previous owner to pick it up and own it back. But you know, it is unlikely going to happen because it is a bottle made out of plastic. It is just one of many. To be replaceable and abandoned, what‚Äôs lonelier than that?‚Äù
        
        Reading his message, I started to remember how much I loved listening to him talk. He had always been a storyteller. In between those lifeless corporate zombies around me, he was incredibly alive. His head was overflowed with interesting ideas, a series of eye-opening life lessons for me to learn, and the other things that sometimes I don‚Äôt quite understand. It almost felt like he knew everything‚Ä¶ except for the things that I knew, which made him think that I walked so bravely in such an extraordinary living path ‚Äî and that made him want to learn from me as well.
        
        ‚ÄúWait, let me think.‚Äù I continued, ‚ÄúFor me, a missing toy is definitely lonelier than a thrown-away plastic bottle! You used to play with it, spend most of your time together‚Ä¶ You love it so much but you lose it. Time passes, you‚Äôll forget about it, and you‚Äôll find a new toy. But little do you know, your toy only knows you for its whole life. It is forever yours, waiting for you to realize that it is now in the invisible corner somewhere, hoping for you to find it. But you‚Äôll forget about it‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs going to spend its whole life being dusty and lonely.‚Äù
        
        ‚ÄúOhhh that‚Äôs a good one! Mine was intentionally thrown away and yours was accidentally lost. Completely the opposites but both are just as lonely.‚Äù
        
        I saw myself being so intrigued by the question that I came up with a few more of the so-called ‚Äúloneliest objects in the world‚Äù.
        
        ‚ÄúOh, another one! A band-aid! Some things were made only to cover scars and thrown away in the bin right after you heal. Can you imagine how lonely that is? and you know that they used you merely for that, but still, you give yourself anyway. Or a diary! You have to listen to someone‚Äôs rant every day without expecting them to listen to you back. They write on you, never about you, they call you dear ‚Äî making you think that they love you when they just want to use you as an ear without a mouth‚Ä¶ I literally never thought that there would be so many lonely objects.‚Äù I said, ending my almost endless suggestions.
        
        He replied, ‚ÄúHonestly can‚Äôt decide which one is the loneliest. I feel like every single one of them is badly hurt and I want to start appreciating my stuffs even more now LOL‚Äù.`

        Try as I might to carry on, my shoulders will sag with relief. Even if I protest that I‚Äôm learning (Estou a aprender!) and I want to blunder on, they will wave me away and roll out the English carpet.

        The Butterfly Effect
        Thinking about this, I recently read the story of Edward Lorenz, an American mathematician and meteorologist who examined a weather method in the 1960s.
        
        In his simulation, he rounded decimal in one of the numbers, and the result was unexpected. It significantly diverged from the original and led to a different weather forecast.
        
        He then named this phenomenon ‚Äúthe butterfly effect‚Äù, where tiny changes lead to a big impact.
        
        As Jay Asher expressed in his thought:
        
        ‚ÄúIf a butterfly flaps its wings at just the right time in just the right place, it can cause a hurricane thousands of miles away. It‚Äôs chaos theory, but see, chaos theory isn‚Äôt exactly about chaos. It‚Äôs about how a tiny change in a big system can affect everything.‚Äù
        
        In real history, for example, America won the Revolutionary War because of a mistake made by a German Colonel named Johann Rall.`

        content:`Every villain‚Äôs tale starts with a man who paved their own way through the world because they were either abandonded, abused, or grieving‚Ää. They had to grow their skin thick so that bullets would simply slide off like an armor well-made for battle. They spent their lives bleeding, so they forged weapons to make others bleed in turn. Turning them into hateful, selfish, and evil human beings with a wounded heart.

        Some philosophers believe that we are all born kind and that society makes us cruel. I agree, for how can you expect a newborn to be evil? A brain that is smooth as skin cannot simply wish for a person‚Äôs downfall; only the world it opens its eyes to is responsible for these ideas. Villains aren‚Äôt born villains; they‚Äôre ordinary individuals who were crushed and condemned to a life of suffering or are simply taught that kindness will bring you nowhere in this world.
        
        Does the villain‚Äôs heart ever feel bad of putting innocent people in the worst position possible? If the world was kinder, are villains ever to exist?
        
        While our upbringing plays a significant role in shaping our identities within society, it is important that we hold ourselves accountable for our actions. While I empathize with those who have suffered, I firmly believe that individuals must not use their past as justification for causing harm. A wounded heart does not grant one the right to inflict pain upon others. This counts from breaking a person‚Äôs heart to leaving millions dead in the middle of the street. In a world where freedom is cherished, true liberty lies in choosing peace and kidness over violence and cruelty.
        
        A villain‚Äôs determination knows no bounds, and their pursuit of victory can be relentless. Their definition of victory will always be unique, for no one knows when their satisfaction to let the world know of their pain comes to an end. But then, despite this, they never win.
        
        The true battle that a villain must face is never against heroes or the people they terrorize, but only within themselves. Our actions will always relfect the deepest corners of our minds no matter how hard we try to cover it and I pity those who needs other people‚Äôs suffering to distract themselves of their own‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääseeking solace from their own demons.`
